# Pascal compiler in Python
Welcome to our README section. This project's goal, as it is mentioned in the title, is to create a compiler in Python for the Pascal language.
As the language the compiler is being created for, some preliminary research/analysis had to be taken care of.
The compiler will stay quite basic as it is part of a school project (with a deadline..).

# Dependency
* graphviz-2.38
* pydot-1.0.3
